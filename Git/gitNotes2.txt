Git is really useful for version control to save individual changes to a code or document. Which I know I could really start getting into the habit of doing. 
I should also really start annotating my code in a useful way.
Things we learned today:
1. git init to start git
2. git status to check the status of any files
3. git add to add a file/its changes to the staging area of git
4. git commit to add the file/its changes to the full repository
5. git commit -m to add a short, specigic message about the purpose of any changes
